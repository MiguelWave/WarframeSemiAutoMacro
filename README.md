# WarframeSemiAutoMacro
Semi automatic Warframe macro cus DE bans everything automated, with gui display and stuff.

# Detailed description
Pet project of mine. Initial goal was to enable spamming abilities by holding down said abilites' key, but it has grown far from its humble roots and into *Rainbow RGB GUI Display* lol.
But yea, lots of features and hopefully more to come, all to assist in, not automate, playing Warframe (DE please don't ban me).
Do keep in mind that all this is based on my own WF keybinds, so if you want to use it you're prolly gonna have to backtrack my keybinds to reconfigure the script to fit yours (Notes regarding this to be added).

# Features
Spam Semi-automatic weapons by holding down fire key.

Spam abilities.

Spam Melee and a special mode to simplify heavy attacking glaives (I found it too bothersome to press 2 buttons when im using my pathocyst so im making so i can just press 1 instead lol).
